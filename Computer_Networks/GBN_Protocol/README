The goal of this assignment is to implement the Go-Back-N protocol, 
which could be used to transfer a text file from one host to another across an unreliable network.

The program can be run by the following command, 
where the arguments are in list form with the given order
Important: run them in the following order, emulator->receiver->sender

Run emulator: ./nEmulator-linux386 
Arguments are:
<emulator's receiving UDP port number in the forward(sender) direction>
<receiver’s network address>
<receiver’s receiving UDP port number>
<emulator's receiving UDP port number in the backward(receiver) direction>
<sender’s network address>
<sender’s receiving UDP port number>
<maximum delay of the link in units of millisecond>
<packet discard probability>
<verbose-mode>

Run Receiver: python3 receiver.py
Arguments are:
<hostname for the network emulator>
<UDP port number used by the link emulator to receive ACKs from the receiver>
<UDP port number used by the receiver to receive data from the emulator>
<name of the file into which the received data is written>

Run Sender: python3 sender.py
Arguments are:
<hostname for the network emulator>
<UDP port number used by the link emulator to receive data from the sender>
<UDP port number used by the sender to receive ACKs from the emulator>
<name of the file to be transferred>

Example execution:
@ubuntu1804-008 ./nEmulator-linux386 9951 ubuntu1804-002 9954 9953 ubuntu1804-004 9952 50 0.2 0
@ubuntu1804-002 python3 receiver.py ubuntu1804-008 9953 9954 out.txt
@ubuntu1804-004 python3 sender.py ubuntu1804-008 9951 9952 in.txt 

I have used python3 to compile the program
Test and build on linux.student.cs environment: z357liu@ubuntu1804-008, z357liu@ubuntu1804-004, z357liu@ubuntu1804-002
