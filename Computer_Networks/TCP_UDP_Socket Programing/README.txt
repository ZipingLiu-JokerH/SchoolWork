The goal of this assignment is to gain experience with both TCP and UDP socket programming in a client- server environment.
Design and implement a client program (client) and a server program (server) to communicate between themselves.

The program can be run by the following command
Run server: ./server.sh <req_code>
Run client: ./client.sh <server address> <n_port> <req_code> <msg>

I have used python3 to compile the program
Test and build on linux.student.cs environment
